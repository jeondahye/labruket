                <b>Where are L:a Bruket products manufactured?</b>
                <p>
                    The products are manufactured here on Sweden's west coast by an experienced team 
                    with extensive knowledge and long experience of manufacturing natural and organic 
                    skin care that extends over generations.

            <div>
                <b>What material are your containers made of?</b>
                <p>
                    We have chosen to use recycled and recyclable PET bottles and cans (PCR-Post 
                    Consumer Recycled) of food quality for most of our range. A large glass bottle 
                    requires more energy to produce, is heavy during transport and may break tiles or 
                    bathroom ceramics if you drop it. Please always remember to recycle your used 
                    containers, made from recyclable materials, as it is still the best alternative to reduce 
                    waste and environmental impact and ensure that plastic does not end up in our 
                    oceans.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b>Are L:a Bruket products organic and natural?</b>
                <p>
                    Defining organic is not as simple as it may seem. As soon as an organic raw material is 
                    processed in any way it is no longer considered organic. For instance, the soy wax in 
                    our candles is made from organic soy, but since processed may not be called organic. 
                    This goes for plants harvested in the wild as well, since they are not controlled through 
                    farming, they may not be called organic. We use both organic raw materials that have 
                    been processed (and therefore cannot be labelled or mentioned as organic) as well as 
                    certified organic ingredients. For some products we have a content of more than 
                    90% certified organic ingredients like for instance our face oil Petitgrain, shea butter 
                    and jojoba oil. The base ingredients of our skin care range are always organic and/ or 
                    natural, however in some cases we may need to use smaller amounts of nature 
                    identical ingredients, such as preservatives that occur naturally in i.e. lingonberries, 
                    but is not possible to produce large scale. They have the same molecular build up as 
                    the natural original but can be produced without exterminating rare species of plants. 
                    Another positive effect is that allergens that may occur naturally in some natural 
                    ingredients can be eliminated.

                <b>Does L:a Bruket use Palm oil?</b>
                <p>
                    We are happy to say we do not use any pure palm oil in any of our products. However, 
                    there might be small amounts/ traces of it hidden in other ingredients we use, but we 
                    are continuously developing formulas to stay clear of any content of palm oil due to 
                    its dubious reputation. We assure the small quantities that may appear within other 
                    ingredients are always RSPO-certified.

                <p>
                    We have a few products that are not completely vegan. Our body butters and lip balm 
                    contain beeswax, but the harvest is not in any way harmful to the bees. All other 
                    products are completely vegan.

                <p>
                    No, we would never use animal testing for neither our ingredients nor our products. 
                    The reason we don&acute;t inform about this fact on our packaging is that it is forbidden 
                    by EU-legislation to mention “not tested on animals” as animal testing is prohibited 
                    within the EU for many years.

                    Opened products will last for about 6 months and is shown by the “Open jar symbol” 
                    on the packaging. However, some products will last a lot longer so always use your 
                    nose to determine the status of the product not to waste a perfectly good product. 
                    Remember that our products have a shelf life (Best Before Date) of about 36 months.

                <p>
                    The titanium dioxide in our sunscreen has no nanoparticles in it. There is titanium 
                    dioxide with nanoparticles and without, as it is the size of the particles that 
                    determines whether “nano” or not. As the use of nanoparticles is disputed, we have 
                    chosen to use titanium dioxide from a 100% natural source without nanoparticles.

                <b>Why are there warning labels on some of you home range products?</b>
                <p>
                    As for our home range products like room diffusers, scented candles and dishwashing 
                    liquids, a global legislation has come into force. It dictates that all products 
                    containing a concentration of perfume/ fragrance that exceeds a certain percentage 
                    must be labelled with a warning. This is regardless if the fragrance consists of natural 
                    essential oils or synthetic perfume. Even if the amount of fragrance oil included in our 
                    room diffusers contributes to about 19% of the total content, and the fragrance 
                    substance which is the requirement for the labelling is only 2% of the total content, 
                    there must be a warning label with standardized phrases of different 
                    warnings/ cautions.

                <b>Does your products contain parabens, silicones or sulphates?</b>
                <p>
                    We never use any parabens, silicones or sulphates in any of our products. The reason 
                    we don&acute;t inform about this fact on our packaging is that it is forbidden by EU-law to 
                    mention what a product “does not” contain.

                <b>How do you scent your skin care products?</b>
                <p>
                    The essential oils in our skin care products gives them a natural fragrance, however 
                    they are not added to give the product a scent first and foremost. The main reason we 
                    use essential oils in our skin care is for their different properties, the scent in itself is 
                    secondary. On rare occasions we add a natural fragrance to a product to give it a 
                    certain scent. For instance, our Broccoli seed serum has a natural cucumber fragrance 
                    added as the active extracts used have no natural scent at all and unfortunately 
                    cucumber cannot produce an essential oil.

                <b>Why is there stated “parfum” in your ingredient list? Is it a synthetic perfume?</b>
                <p>
                    Due to changes in EU legislation all products containing any kind of fragrance, natural 
                    essential oils or synthetic, must have the word “Parfum” stated in the ingredient list. 
                    For home care products it should be stated as “Perfume”. To clarify what we use we 
                    added a bracket to our ingredient list explaining if it is a mix of essential oils or a 
                    natural fragrance. Product experience & Product use

                <b>Can your products differ in scent and texture?</b>
                <p>
                    Since we use natural ingredients the texture and scent may vary from one harvest to 
                    another depending on soil conditions as well as weather conditions of little or much 
                    rain or sunshine.

                <b>Why does my skin get white from the sunscreen?</b>
                <p>
                    We innovate natural products and for that reason we of course chose to make a 
                    sunscreen without chemical filters. Chemical sunscreen filters penetrate the skin and 
                    absorbs the sun radiation through a chemical process and converts it to unharmful 
                    radiation. These chemical filters are debated in what way they might impact the body 
                    as well as what environmental damage they may cause for coral reefs and aquatic 
                    life. We have chosen to use a physical UV filter of titanium dioxide, protecting the skin 
                    by reflecting harmful sun rays and providing a beautiful tan without burning. This 
                    means our sun protection leaves the skin slightly white after application.

                <b>How come a scent smells differently depending on product?</b>
                <p>
                    The fragrance base is the same in all three products, however the rest of the 
                    ingredients in a product carry the scent differently why we will perceive it in numerous 
                    ways depending on the product.

                <b>What if I have an allergic reaction to a product?</b>
                <p>
                    There might be several reasons for a skin reaction to a natural product. Some people 
                    are sensitive or allergic to allergens that may occur in essential oils like; linalool, 
                    limonene and geraniol etc. Another reason is skin not being used to active natural 
                    ingredients. Skin might blush and burn at first, bit this will pass after continuous use as 
                    it gets used to an increased stimulation of skin&acute;s circulation. Yet another reason might 
                    be hormonal imbalances making skin blush suddenly after using a product that has 
                    been used many times before. If you should experience a reaction to any of our 
                    products and feel insecure of the reason, please contact us.

                <b>Are L:a Bruket&acute;s products safe to use in the sun?</b>
                <p>
                    Our products are safe to use in the sun, however sensitive people may experience a 
                    reaction to the essential oil of bergamot if spending time in the sun right after 
                    application. The amount of essential oil is extremely low in all our products (less than 
                    1% of the total content) so if you use bergamot products in the morning you should not 
                    experience any problems spending time in the sun later in the day.

                <b>Can you use L:a Bruket&acute;s products on children?</b>
                <p>
                    We use natural ingredients which makes most of our products well suited for sensitive 
                    and delicate skin. The scents used come from natural essential oils from herbs, and 
                    even though the content of essential oil is a very small percentage, a few people may 
                    be sensitive to allergens naturally occurring in essential oils. Children and infants have 
                    of course more sensitive skin and if you don&acute;t feel comfortable trying a scented 
                    product for your child you can always use our all natural and unscented products; 
                    No 047 Jojoba oil, No 016 Shea butter and No 017 Lip balm.

                <p>
                    As the amount of essential oils are less than 1% in each product, one should not need 
                    to worry about using for instance facial products with essential oils during pregnancy. 
                    But of course, if you feel any hesitation, we can always recommend our unscented 
                    natural products; No 016 Shea butter that works for body, hands, feet and elbows and 
                    No 047 Jojoba oil that is perfect for face care and cuticles as well as for preventing
                    stretchmarks.
