                    Our skin care products are marked with a Best Before Date. Up until this date we 
                    guarantee the product will keep its quality standard. The best before date is only a 
                    recommendation, why the product can be used way beyond the date, however e.g. 
                    function and scent may be degraded. Since we are using natural ingredients, they may 
                    vary from one season to another depending on weather and soil conditions. This may 
                    affect e.g. the scent experience between different batches even if we are using the

                    although we offered a common and generally acceptable type of delivery which

                    amount corresponding to the common and generally acceptable type of delivery. 
                    Shipping fees are not reimbursed for partial returns.
